Experiments with p5.js for a hackathon

Overview
This project uses machine learning to create an engaging and interactive twist on Pong. By moving their hands up and down, players can control the paddle position and interact with the game without any physical controllers.

Features
Real-Time Motion Capture: Uses PoseNet to detect hand movements and control paddle position.
Classic Pong Mechanics: Bounce the ball, avoid missing, and rack up points.
Visual Feedback: Optional visual indicators for hand detection.

Tech Stack
P5.js for game rendering and graphics.
ml5.js (PoseNet) for motion capture and hand position detection.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the interface and structure.
